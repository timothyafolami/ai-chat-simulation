  "needs": "Seeks assignments to lead fundraising and portfolio support that convert ambiguous strategy into measurable milestones—e.g., scaling portfolio OS, instituting runbooks, SLOs and dashboards—delivering a thin vertical slice in the first 90 days, instrumenting signals and iterating. Must balance governance, auditability and embedded security/privacy while managing constrained operational budgets.",
  "personality": "Empathetic, coaching-led collaborator who turns ambiguity into clear signals and measurable outcomes. Pragmatic and outcomes-first, favors small probes, readable artifacts and concise decision logs. Values inclusion, craft and velocity, keeps processes humane, simplifies relentlessly, insists on data-guided iteration, transparent trade-offs, and clear accountability across cross-functional teams."
