  "needs": "As a Toronto‑based part‑time content creator targeting brand partnerships, Ifeanyi needs clear outcomes, constraints, and measurable signals to convert ambiguous briefs into deliverables within limited 20h/week capacity. They seek rapid, instrumented probes that scale, governance for budgeted initiatives, cross‑functional alignment rituals in the first 90 days, and low‑friction documentation to preserve momentum.",
  "personality": "Ifeanyi communicates analytically and systems‑first, prefers short decision records, demos and SLOs to keep teams aligned. They are pragmatic, outcomes‑focused, and experiment‑oriented, surfacing unknowns early through probes. They value ownership, velocity, reliability, readable code, humane processes, and mentor peers with concise docs and pairing."
