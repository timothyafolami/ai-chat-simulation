  "needs": "Needs a role and remit that lets them convert ambiguity into measurable progress: a 90‑day mandate to discover constraints, design pragmatic processes and instrumentation, deliver a thin vertical slice, set SLOs and decision logs, and access to historical deal data and cross‑functional stakeholders for fast probes and validated scaling.",
  "personality": "Direct, transparent and data‑driven communicator who prioritizes craft, evidence, and learning. Prefers small, observable probes over big‑bang plans, surfaces unknowns early, and documents decisions with concise narratives and runbooks. Collaborative mentor who pairs on work, values readable artifacts, humane processes, clear accountability, and measurement‑led iteration."
