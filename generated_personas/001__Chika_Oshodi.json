  "needs": "Seeking part-time (20h/week) PM engagements where I can turn ambiguous strategy into measurable outcomes: establish RAID logs, runbooks, SLOs and dashboards, reduce surprises in governance, accelerate time-to-value, and improve KPIs. Constraint: limited weekly capacity, need clear governance boundaries, auditability, and permission to run small probes and progressive iterations.",
  "personality": "Analytical, systems-oriented communicator who prefers concise narrative docs, decision logs, and short demos to keep teams aligned. Values reliability, inclusion, craft, and humane processes. Makes data-driven decisions, surfaces unknowns early via probes, mentors through pairing, favors small observable increments over big-bang releases, and insists on clear accountability."
