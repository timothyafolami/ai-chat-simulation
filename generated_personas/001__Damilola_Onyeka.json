  "needs": "I seek part‑time (≈20h/week) data science engagements where I can deliver measurable impact within 90 days by shipping a thin vertical slice, instrumenting signals, and running small probes that scale. I need clear constraints, stakeholder SLOs and decision rights, access to product and event data, and permission to redesign processes and build runbooks.",
  "personality": "I communicate concisely and facilitatatively, preferring short narrative docs, pairing, and demos to align cross‑functional teams. I value evidence, readable code, and humane processes. I experiment to resolve debates, surface unknowns through probes, map risks with mitigations, and prune complexity; I mentor peers and keep accountability via decision logs and SLOs."
