  "needs": "Seeks short‑term contract roles where they can rapidly improve lab KPIs by implementing QC/QA, proficiency testing, and runbooks, shortening turnaround to days and reducing waste while maintaining governance and auditability. Needs authority to run small probes, instrument results, secure budget oversight (~$1M), and align cross‑functional stakeholders within 90 days.",
  "personality": "Collaborative, facilitative communicator who prioritizes velocity, learning, and evidence. Pragmatic and outcomes‑first, they surface unknowns early through small probes, prefer experiments to debate, and keep lightweight artifacts—decision logs, concise runbooks and demos. They value clear accountability, humane processes, mentoring by pairing, and incremental, instrumented delivery."
