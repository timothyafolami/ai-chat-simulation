  "needs": "Lerato seeks part‑time (20h/wk) lab roles where they can shorten diagnostic turnaround and improve accuracy through small probes, SLOs, runbooks, and measurable signals. They aim to deliver a thin vertical slice within the first 90 days, preserve auditability and biosafety, and balance cross‑functional alignment under constrained hours and regulatory governance.",
  "personality": "Empathetic, coaching‑led communicator who surfaces unknowns early and prefers experiments over debates. Lerato writes concise decision logs and demos, mentors by pairing, and privileges readable processes, humane workflows, and clear accountability. They are data‑driven, iterative, and focused on learning, velocity, and reliability while keeping artifacts lightweight and stakeholder updates crisp."
