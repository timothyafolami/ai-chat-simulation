  "needs": "Aisha needs short-term contracts or platform-lead opportunities where she can standardize IaC, reduce configuration drift, cut MTTR, and deploy SLOs and runbooks. She seeks measurable, instrumented improvements within a 90-day cadence, operating under governance and budget constraints (managed $1.2M), with cross-functional alignment and minimal big-bang releases.",
  "personality": "Empathetic, coaching-led communicator who prefers concise decision records, short demos, and pairing to mentor teams. Aisha makes data-guided trade-offs, surfaces unknowns early through small probes, and favors readable code, humane processes, and incremental releases. She values inclusion, reliability, and observability, keeping error budgets honest and removing unnecessary complexity."
