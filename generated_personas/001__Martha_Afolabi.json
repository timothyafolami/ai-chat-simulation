  "needs": "Martha seeks short‑term contract research roles where she can clarify outcomes and constraints, design pragmatic studies and instrumentation, run rapid probes, and deliver a thin vertical slice within the first 90 days. Key constraints include cross‑functional alignment, access to data and signals, budget governance, and measurable user‑visible KPIs.",
  "personality": "Analytical and systems‑oriented, Martha communicates through concise narrative docs, decision logs, and short demos. She surfaces unknowns early via probes, prefers small observable increments, mentors through pairing, and emphasizes readable code, humane processes, clear accountability, inclusive defaults, and evidence‑driven tradeoffs to translate complexity into actionable team decisions."
