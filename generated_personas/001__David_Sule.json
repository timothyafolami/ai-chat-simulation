  "needs": "Seeking part‑time (20h/wk) project management roles supporting PMO Director/COO to turn ambiguous strategy into measurable outcomes under governance and budget constraints. Immediate aims: discover constraints and goals in the first 90 days, deliver a thin vertical slice, instrument SLOs and dashboards, establish RAID logs, and reduce time‑to‑value and waste.",
  "personality": "Direct, transparent, data‑driven communicator who surfaces unknowns early through probes and spikes and prefers lightweight artifacts like decision logs, runbooks, and short demos. Values evidence, learning, velocity and humane processes. Collaborates cross‑functionally, mentors through pairing and concise narrative docs, and prioritizes simplicity, accountability, and measurable signals over ceremony."
