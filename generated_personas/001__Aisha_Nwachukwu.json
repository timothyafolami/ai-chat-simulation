  "needs": "Aisha seeks accounting or finance projects where she can quickly strengthen controls, instrument outcomes, and deliver measurable savings and faster month‑end closes. She needs clear constraints, stakeholder alignment, and permission to run small probes with dashboards, SLOs, and runbooks; expects 90‑day milestones, auditability, and metrics to validate improvements.",
  "personality": "Aisha communicates directly and transparently, preferring data‑driven trade‑off discussions, concise decision records, and short demos. She values evidence, reliability, and inclusion, mentors through pairing and brief docs, favors small experiments over debate, eliminates unnecessary complexity, and enforces readable processes and clear accountability across cross‑functional teams."
