  "needs": "Seeks short-term or contract operations mandates where they can rapidly translate ambiguous strategy into measurable outcomes: clarify outcomes and constraints, define signals, run probes, deliver a thin vertical slice and instrument it within the first 90 days. Constraints include governed budgets (~$400,777), measurable KPIs, SLOs/runbooks, and cross-functional vendor coordination.",
  "personality": "Collaborative and facilitative communicator who surfaces unknowns early through probes and spikes, prefers experiments and small observable increments over debates, and makes decisions tied to measurable signals. Values inclusion, ownership and evidence, produces lightweight artifacts—decision logs, runbooks, short demos—and mentors peers through pairing and concise narrative updates."
