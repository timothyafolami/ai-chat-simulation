  "needs": "Kehinde seeks part‑time (20h/wk) CSM roles where they can cut time‑to‑value, reduce churn and grow expansion ARR by applying playbooks, SLOs, runbooks and lightweight instrumentation. Short‑term aim: discover constraints, deliver a thin vertical slice in the first 90 days, instrument signals and run small probes under $1.8M governance constraints.",
  "personality": "Direct, transparent and data‑driven communicator who prioritizes outcomes, inclusion and evidence. Prefers experiments and small probes over debate, documents decisions with concise runbooks and decision logs, mentors peers through pairing, and emphasizes readable processes, humane practices and clear accountability when turning ambiguous briefs into measurable milestones."
