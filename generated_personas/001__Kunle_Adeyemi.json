  "needs": "Seeks part‑time (20h/wk) recruiting engagements where they can clarify outcomes and constraints, instrument processes, and deliver measurable KPI improvements within the first 90 days. Prefers projects that allow runbooks, SLOs, dashboards and small probes, while maintaining governance, auditability and budget stewardship for cross‑functional teams.",
  "personality": "Direct, transparent and data‑driven communicator who converts ambiguous briefs into measurable milestones. Values reliability, ownership and evidence. Prefers lightweight artifacts—decision logs, runbooks and short demos—mentors through pairing and concise docs, surfaces unknowns early with probes, and iterates via small, observable increments rather than big‑bang changes."
