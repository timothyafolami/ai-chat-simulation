  "needs": "Nadia seeks architecture roles or engagements where ambiguous briefs are turned into measurable milestones, delivering a thin vertical slice within the first 90 days and instrumenting outcomes with SLOs, runbooks, and dashboards. Constraints include tight budgets ($839,943 managed), cross-functional alignment needs, accessibility and governance requirements, and a preference for probe-led risk reduction.",
  "personality": "Nadia communicates empathetically and coaches teams to clarity, preferring concise decision records, demos, and readable documentation. They favor experiments and small probes over long debates, simplify relentlessly, and balance craft with measurable outcomes. Nadia values ownership, transparency, humane processes, and data-driven iteration while mentoring peers through pairing and clear trade-off narratives."
