  "needs": "Seeks contract Customer Success Manager roles where she can deliver measurable outcomes quickly: reduce churn, drive expansion ARR, and cut time-to-value using playbooks, runbooks, SLOs and dashboards. Prefers 90-day outcomes-driven engagements in Dubai/UTC, with clear governance, budget accountability, cross-functional alignment, and scope for small probes and A/B tests.",
  "personality": "Analytical, systems-oriented communicator who values evidence, inclusion and continuous learning. She favors lightweight artifacts—decision logs, concise demos and runbooks—to keep momentum visible; prefers experiments and prototypes over debate, mentors peers through pairing and clear narratives, and optimizes for readable code, humane processes and transparent accountability."
