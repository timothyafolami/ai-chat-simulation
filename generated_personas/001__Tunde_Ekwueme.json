  "needs": "Seeks Head-of-Growth or CPO-level engagements (contract) in Dublin/UTC to deliver measurable growth: rebuild lifecycle and funnels, lift LTV and retention, and accelerate activation within early quarters. Requires clear constraints, instrumentation, budget visibility, cross-functional alignment, and permission to run small probes and progressive rollouts.",
  "personality": "Collaborative, facilitative communicator who prioritises evidence, velocity, and reliability. Prefers concise artifacts—decision logs, runbooks, short demos—and mentors peers through pairing and narrative docs. Pragmatic experimenter who surfaces unknowns early, values simplicity and readable processes, and opts for small, observable increments tied to measurable user outcomes."
