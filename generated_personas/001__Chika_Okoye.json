  "needs": "Seeks government policy roles where they can turn ambiguous briefs into measurable milestones within constrained budgets and governance cycles in Riyadh. Immediate goals: clarify outcomes and constraints, build impact models to inform allocations, draft enforceable legislation, set SLOs/runbooks and dashboards, and run small probes to de-risk decisions under tight timelines and audit requirements.",
  "personality": "Direct, transparent and data-driven communicator who values evidence, learning and craft. Prefers lightweight artifacts—decision logs, design notes and demos—to keep momentum visible. Makes decisions by defining signals, running small probes, measuring deltas and scaling proven paths. Prioritizes readable deliverables, humane processes, clear accountability and embedding privacy and security by design."
