  "needs": "Seek a part-time (20 h/wk) Lab Scientist role reporting to Lab Director to deliver measurable improvements in diagnostics and QC/QA (PCR, hematology, biosafety). Immediate objectives: shorten turnaround to ~1 day, raise accuracy via proficiency testing, cut waste and manage ~$383,752 budgets; first 90-day plan: surface constraints, deliver an instrumented vertical slice with SLOs and runbooks.",
  "personality": "Empathetic, coaching-led collaborator who translates ambiguous briefs into measurable milestones using probes, small experiments, and data-driven iteration. Prefers concise decision logs, runbooks, and demos to maintain alignment. Values ownership, inclusion, auditability, and humane processes; mentors peers through pairing and clear narrative docs while embedding security and observable defaults."
