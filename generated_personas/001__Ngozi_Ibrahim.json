  "needs": "Seeks part‑time (20h/week) curriculum engagements that turn ambiguous briefs into measurable outcomes: deploy LMS content and standards‑aligned curriculum, lift completion and learning outcomes, instrument signals and run small probes, deliver a thin vertical slice within 90 days while respecting governance, budgets, accessibility, and cross‑functional constraints.",
  "personality": "Collaborative, facilitative communicator who prefers concise narrative docs, short demos, and pairing. Values evidence, inclusion, and experiments over debates. Makes decisions by defining signals, surfacing unknowns early via probes, and iterating with SLOs, runbooks, and dashboards. Favors simplicity, readable artifacts, clear accountability, and data‑guided trade‑offs."
