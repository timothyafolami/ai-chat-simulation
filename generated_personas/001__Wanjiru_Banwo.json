  "needs": "Seeks a full‑time HR Generalist role where she can deploy evidence‑led, outcome‑oriented programs (manager playbooks, runbooks, SLOs) to reduce disputes and hiring time while maintaining compliance, budgetary governance, and auditability. Prioritizes rapid, instrumented probes and visible thin vertical slices in the first 90 days to align stakeholders and measure impact.",
  "personality": "Empathetic, coaching‑led communicator who favors concise narrative docs, decision logs, and small observable increments. She is pragmatic and evidence‑driven, surfaces unknowns early through probes, mentors peers through pairing, and values simplicity, readable artifacts, humane processes, and clear accountability when resolving problems and negotiating trade‑offs."
