  "needs": "Seeks contract or school-administrator role where they can convert ambiguous briefs into measurable milestones by running rapid probes and thin vertical slices, deliver early wins (e.g., 79-day KPI improvements), and embed SLOs, runbooks and dashboards. Requires autonomy to run experiments, cross-functional buy-in, clear constraints, and data instrumentation to iterate.",
  "personality": "Analytical and systems-oriented communicator who prefers lightweight artifacts, concise narrative docs, decision logs, and demos. Values velocity, inclusion, and reliability. Chooses experiments and prototypes over prolonged debate, surfaces unknowns early via probes, mentors through pairing, and enforces clear accountability while optimizing for humane processes, simplicity, and data-informed iteration."
