  "needs": "Seeks part-time (20h/wk) product design engagements reporting to a Head of Design/CPO where Chika can deliver measurable outcomes within the first 90 days: a thin vertical slice, instrumentation, and iterative probes. Requires access to product metrics and engineering partners, decision authority or clear constraints, plus governance, security, and audit alignment.",
  "personality": "Collaborative, facilitative, and evidence-driven, Chika prefers small, observable experiments and prototypes to settle debates. They prioritize ownership, craft, accessibility, readable artifacts, and humane processes. Communication is concise: SLOs, decision logs, and short demos. They surface unknowns early, map risks, mentor peers through pairing, and iterate by data."
