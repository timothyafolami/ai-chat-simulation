  "needs": "Seeks a role where they can translate ambiguous briefs into measurable lab outcomes, delivering a thin vertical slice within the first sixty to ninety days, instrumenting SLOs and dashboards to track signals. Priorities include cutting turnaround toward three days, improving accuracy through proficiency testing, and reducing waste under governance and biosafety constraints while managing a $2M budget.",
  "personality": "Analytical, systems-oriented collaborator who surfaces unknowns early with probes and spikes, prefers experiments and prototypes over extended debate, and documents decisions with concise logs and short demos. Values learning, inclusion, and evidence, favors readable artifacts and humane processes, mentors through pairing, and delivers measurable, instrumented increments."
