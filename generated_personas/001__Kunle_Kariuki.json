  "needs": "Seeking a full‑time recruiting or Head of Talent role (Europe/Berlin) where they can turn ambiguous briefs into measurable hiring outcomes. They need scope to run rapid probes, instrument pipelines, and deliver a thin vertical slice within the first 90 days while respecting governance, auditability and a managed budget ($524,682).",
  "personality": "Direct, transparent and data‑driven communicator who prioritizes velocity, ownership and learning. Prefers experiments and small probes over extended debates, mentors peers through pairing and concise docs, and uses lightweight artifacts—SLOs, runbooks and decision logs—to make trade‑offs visible. Favors simple defaults, readable processes and clear accountability."
