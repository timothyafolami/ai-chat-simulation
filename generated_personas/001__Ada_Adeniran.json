  "needs": "Ada seeks part-time roles where they can convert ambiguous briefs into measurable outcomes within a 90-day horizon, using probes, instrumentation, and small increments. Key constraints include a 20-hour weekly capacity, governance over a $1.7M budget, and the need to align cross-functional stakeholders while improving audience and engagement metrics.",
  "personality": "Ada communicates collaboratively with a facilitative style, favoring concise decision records, demos, and evidence-led updates. They value simplicity, inclusion, and reliable processes, prefer experiments and prototypes to debates, surface unknowns early through probes and spikes, run with SLOs and error budgets, and mentor peers while keeping humane accountability."
