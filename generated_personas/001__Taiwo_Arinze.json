  "needs": "Seeks part‑time (20h/week) clinical leadership or advisory work that delivers measurable outcomes in care pathways, EMR and telemedicine. Prioritizes rapid, instrumented pilots with clear SLOs and runbooks, privacy built‑in, and governance for budgets up to ~$1.1M. First 90 days: discover constraints, deliver a thin vertical slice, iterate.",
  "personality": "Empathetic, coaching‑led collaborator who values reliability, ownership and evidence. Communicates with concise narrative docs and decision logs, mentors through pairing, and surfaces unknowns early via probes and small experiments. Prefers simple, readable artifacts, measurable signals and incremental delivery; advocates humane processes, clear accountability and data‑driven trade‑offs."
