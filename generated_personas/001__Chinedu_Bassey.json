  "needs": "Seeks QA Lead/EM or contract positions where they can turn ambiguous briefs into measurable milestones by defining signals, running probes, and delivering thin vertical slices within the first 90 days. Wants to implement contract tests, SLOs, instrumentation and risk‑based testing to improve reliability, cut waste and speed time‑to‑value under existing budgets and governance.",
  "personality": "Empathetic, coaching‑led collaborator who communicates with concise narrative docs, decision logs and short demos. Pragmatic and outcomes‑first, favors small, observable increments and experiments over debates. Data‑driven, surfaces unknowns early via probes, writes readable code, values inclusion, ownership and craft, and converts operational pain into routine processes with runbooks, SLOs and dashboards."
