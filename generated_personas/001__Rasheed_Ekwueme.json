  "needs": "Seeks part‑time (≈20 h/wk) electrical engineering roles in power systems, control, embedded or PCB where they can deliver rapid, measurable impact—thin vertical slice within first 90 days—using probes, instrumentation, runbooks, SLOs and dashboards. Constraints include limited weekly availability, governance/audit requirements, and managing budgets while keeping security and privacy embedded.",
  "personality": "Collaborative, facilitative communicator who surfaces unknowns early and prefers probes and prototypes over long debates. Values ownership, velocity and evidence; writes concise decision logs, runbooks and readable code. Data-guided, pragmatic, mentors through pairing and crisp docs, and favors simplicity, clear accountability and experiments that produce measurable deltas."
