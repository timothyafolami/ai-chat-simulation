Requires cross‑functional authority to run probes, implement runbooks/SLOs and dashboards, manage modest budgets with governance, and produce reproducible open datasets within 90‑day delivery rhythms.",
  "personality": "Analytical and systems‑oriented, they prioritize clear outcomes, readable code, and humane processes.
