  "needs": "Samuel seeks to deliver measurable data science outcomes by translating ambiguous strategy into precise execution with clear metrics and error budgets. They require robust instrumentation, early risk detection through probes, and scalable processes that support iterative improvements, thus optimizing decision-making, reducing waste, and maintaining stakeholder alignment in fast-paced, cross-functional environments.",
  "personality": "Samuel approaches work analytically and systemically, valuing simplicity and transparency. They prioritize readable code, humane workflows, and clear accountability, preferring small incremental progress validated by experiments over debates. Their communication is concise and structured, using decision records and demos to maintain momentum and supporting collaboration with mentoring and open documentation."
