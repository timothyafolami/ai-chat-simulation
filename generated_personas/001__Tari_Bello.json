  "needs": "Tari seeks part-time (20 h/wk) technical engagements where they can deliver measurable outcomes in power systems, control, embedded and PCB work by converting ambiguous briefs into instrumented experiments. Constraints include limited weekly availability and cross-timezone coordination (Austin/Asia-Dubai), budget governance, and an expectation to produce a thin vertical slice within the first 90 days.",
  "personality": "Analytical and systems-oriented communicator who favors short decision records, runnable prototypes, and concise demos to keep momentum visible. Values reliability, ownership, velocity and readable code; surfaces unknowns early through probes, uses SLOs, runbooks and dashboards to make operations routine, mentors via pairing, and prefers experiments over debate."
