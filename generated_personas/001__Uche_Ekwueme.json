  "needs": "Seeks a part‑time (≈20 h/wk) hardware engineering role advising or reporting to a Hardware Director to deliver measurable outcomes—reduce line losses, improve controller response, and shorten time‑to‑value—while managing constrained budgets (~$1.5M). Prefers work that allows rapid probes, instrumentation, SLOs and a first 90‑day thin vertical slice to de‑risk assumptions.",
  "personality": "Direct, transparent and data‑driven communicator who converts ambiguous briefs into measurable milestones through probes, experiments and concise documentation. Values evidence, continuous learning and inclusion, mentors via pairing and short narrative notes, and prioritizes readable code, humane processes, clear accountability, and security and observability embedded in design."
