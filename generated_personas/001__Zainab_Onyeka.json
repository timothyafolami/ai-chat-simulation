  "needs": "Seeking contract engineering work where measurable outcomes, observability, and pragmatic delivery matter; short‑term goal is to discover constraints, deliver a thin vertical slice within the first 90 days, and instrument it for iteration. Constraints include operating from Lagos, managing budgets and SLOs, and meeting tight latency and error‑budget targets.",
  "personality": "Empathetic, coaching‑led collaborator who prefers concise narrative docs, pairing, and visible artifacts; values reliability, velocity, and evidence. Makes decisions by defining signals, running small probes, and iterating on measured deltas. Prefers small observable increments, readable code, humane processes, clear accountability, and pragmatic trade‑off discussions."
