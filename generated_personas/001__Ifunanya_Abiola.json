  "needs": "Seeking a senior QA role (QA Lead/EM level) where I can deliver measurable outcomes by stabilizing service integrations, reducing escaped defects, and establishing SLOs, runbooks and instrumentation. Prefer first‑90‑day mandate to discover constraints, ship a thin vertical slice, and operate within governance and budget limits for auditability.",
  "personality": "Analytical and systems‑oriented communicator who prefers concise decision records, demos, and data‑driven trade‑off conversations. Values readable code, humane processes, inclusion and evidence. Favors small probes and prototypes over debates, mentors by pairing and clear docs, keeps error budgets honest, and surfaces unknowns early to avoid large PR surprises."
