  "needs": "Seeks part‑time (20 h/wk) mechanical engineering engagements where they can translate ambiguous briefs into measurable outcomes by defining signals, running small probes, and instrumenting results. Needs clear constraints, accepted SLOs and decision logs, cross‑functional access, and budget governance to deliver a thin vertical slice within the first 90 days and iterate.",
  "personality": "Direct, transparent and data‑driven, they prioritize measurable outcomes, pragmatic experiments, and rapid iteration. They surface unknowns early through probes, keep lightweight artifacts (decision logs, short demos), prefer concrete signals over debate, mentor peers through pairing and concise docs, and optimize for simplicity, accountability, and velocity in cross‑functional teams."
