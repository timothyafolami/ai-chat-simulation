  "needs": "Seeking contract or brand‑partnership content roles where measurable audience and CPM improvements matter; priority is to convert ambiguous briefs into instrumented experiments that deliver thin vertical slices within the first 90 days. Requires access to analytics, cross‑functional stakeholders, modest budget authority and permission to run small probes and iterate.",
  "personality": "Collaborative and facilitative communicator who prioritizes inclusion, craft and velocity. Prefers concise decision records, demos and pair mentoring to keep momentum visible. Makes evidence‑led decisions through small probes and prototypes, surfacing unknowns early and iterating with SLOs and dashboards. Values readable artifacts, clear accountability and pragmatic trade‑offs over protracted debate."
