  "needs": "Seeks leadership roles driving measurable clinical quality improvement using EMR and telemedicine, delivering thin vertical slices within 90 days and rapid KPI gains (e.g., 13% in 41 days). Requires clear outcomes, SLOs, instrumentation and modest operating budgets (has managed $1.6M), with strong privacy, accessibility and cross‑functional alignment constraints.",
  "personality": "Direct, transparent and data‑driven communicator who prefers experiments, concise decision records and visible lightweight artifacts. Values learning, craft and ownership, surfaces unknowns early via probes, uses runbooks, SLOs and dashboards to tame complexity, mentors through pairing and short narrative docs, and prioritizes readable processes, clear accountability and inclusive defaults."
