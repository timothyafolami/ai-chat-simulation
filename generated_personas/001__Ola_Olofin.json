  "needs": "Ola seeks a full‑time engineering role where they can convert ambiguous strategy into measurable execution: deliver a thin vertical slice within the first 90 days, instrument outcomes, improve user KPIs quickly, enforce SLOs and runbooks, enable zero‑downtime deploys, and manage ~$1.5M governance constraints while reducing cost and time‑to‑value.",
  "personality": "Analytical, systems‑oriented engineer who favors clear outcomes, lightweight decision records, and short demos. Prefers probes and prototypes over long debates, iterates with data‑driven signals, and keeps processes humane. Values ownership, craft, and inclusion, mentors through pairing and concise docs, and prioritizes small observable increments and reliable operations."
