  "needs": "Seeks part‑time (20h/wk) hardware or control engagements in Riyadh that produce measurable outcomes within 90 days. Needs clear outcomes, constraints, and signals up front, permission to run small probes and instrument results, defined SLOs and decision logs, and budget visibility to reduce losses, cut time‑to‑value, and scale chosen solutions.",
  "personality": "Analytical, systems‑oriented communicator who converts ambiguity into measurable milestones through concise decision records, short demos, and pairing. Values evidence, ownership, inclusion, and readable artifacts. Prefers small, observable increments, early probes over large PRs, clear SLOs, and transparent trade‑offs. Mentors through succinct narrative docs and pragmatic, data‑guided iteration."
