  "needs": "Needs to secure short‑term contract or school role that allows rapid, measurable improvement in student outcomes by delivering a pragmatic first vertical slice within ~90 days, instrumenting signals and running probes to reduce disengagement and lift pass rates. Must work within budget/governance constraints, align stakeholders, and prioritize accessible, low‑cost interventions.",
  "personality": "Analytical and systems‑oriented communicator who prefers concise narrative docs, decision records, and short demos to keep momentum visible. Values inclusion, ownership, and velocity. Makes decisions through small experiments, probes, and measurable signals; mentors through pairing, surfaces risks early, and favors deleting complexity while maintaining clear accountability and accessible processes."
