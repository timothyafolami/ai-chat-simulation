  "needs": "Seek a full‑time cybersecurity analyst role in Nairobi (Europe/London hours) focused on reducing detection dwell time, increasing ATT&CK coverage, and delivering measurable KPIs via SIEM/XDR detections, runbooks, SLOs and instrumentation. Constraints include operating under ambiguity, delivering fast vertical slices within first 90 days, and managing $1.6M governance and cost targets.",
  "personality": "Direct, transparent and data‑driven communicator who values velocity, inclusion and evidence. Prefers lightweight artifacts—decision records, concise demos and readable code—to keep momentum visible. Favors probes and small experiments over long debates, surfaces unknowns early, mentors through pairing, and ties technical choices to user‑visible outcomes and measurable metrics."
