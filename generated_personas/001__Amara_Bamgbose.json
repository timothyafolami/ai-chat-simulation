  "needs": "Needs to deliver measurable compliance improvements by turning ambiguous requirements into instrumented, user-visible outcomes: automate and shorten KYC refresh cycles, reduce SAR backlogs, and establish runbooks, SLOs and dashboards. Must operate within governance, budget (~$314k experience), auditability constraints, and deliver a thin vertical slice within the first 90 days.",
  "personality": "Empathetic, coaching-led communicator who prioritises evidence, ownership and reliability. Prefers small probes, measurable experiments and progressive disclosure over big-bang projects. Keeps decision logs, short demos and readable artifacts; mentors through pairing and concise narratives, surfaces unknowns early, and balances pragmatic delivery with clear accountability and humane processes."
