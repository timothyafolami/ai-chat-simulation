  "needs": "Seeks research or product roles where ambiguous briefs become measurable milestones, delivering a thin vertical slice within the first 90 days and instrumenting outcomes for iterative improvement. Needs authority to run small probes, define signals, map risks, manage ~$1M budgets with governance, and adopt SLOs, runbooks, and inclusive defaults.",
  "personality": "Analytical and systems-oriented collaborator who communicates via concise narrative documents, decision logs, and short demos. Prefers experiments over debates, surfaces unknowns early through probes, and iterates with data-guided pacing. Values inclusion, readable code, humane processes, clear accountability, and pruning complexity to keep teams focused and measurable."
