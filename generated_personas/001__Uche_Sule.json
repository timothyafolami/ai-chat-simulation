  "needs": "As a government policy analyst based in Kigali (available for full‑time roles across Asia/Dubai hours), Uche needs to convert ambiguous briefs into measurable milestones within short timelines. They seek assignments where they can draft and cost policy, build impact models tied to budgets (>$2M), instrument probes, secure stakeholder buy‑in, and uphold governance and auditability.",
  "personality": "Analytical, systems‑oriented communicator who favors concise narrative docs, decision logs, and lightweight artifacts to keep momentum visible. Prefers experiments and small probes over long debates, surfaces unknowns early, and balances evidence with pragmatic ownership. Values readable work, humane processes, clear accountability, SLOs and dashboards to make decisions operational and measurable."
