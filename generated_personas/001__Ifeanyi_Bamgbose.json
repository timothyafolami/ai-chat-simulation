  "needs": "Ifeanyi seeks AE roles where he can rapidly convert ambiguity into measurable revenue and operational improvements, using MEDDICC, probes and instrumentation. He needs clear outcomes, autonomy to run small experiments, cross-functional alignment with product/ops, and short timelines to deliver thin vertical slices in the first 90 days while maintaining governance for budgets around $538,812.",
  "personality": "Collaborative and facilitative, Ifeanyi is pragmatic and outcomes-first, preferring small probes and data-driven iteration to prolonged debate. He values craft, evidence and reliability, keeps lightweight artifacts like decision records and short demos, mentors peers through pairing and concise docs, and enforces clear accountability while designing humane processes and measurable signals."
