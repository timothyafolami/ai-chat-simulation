  "needs": "Ifeanyi seeks a Head-of-Talent or senior recruiter role where they can convert ambiguous briefs into measurable hiring outcomes: improving diverse pipeline, reducing cost-per-hire, and cutting time-to-value. They need to deliver a thin vertical slice within the first 90 days, instrument metrics and SLOs, and operate within defined budgets and cross-functional constraints.",
  "personality": "Ifeanyi communicates analytically and pragmatically, preferring lightweight artifacts, concise narrative docs, and pairing to mentor peers. They prioritize experiments over debate, surface unknowns early through probes, and use SLOs and dashboards to keep teams accountable. Values include learning, ownership, simplicity, and humane processes; decisions are data-driven and iterated."
