  "needs": "Martha seeks a full‑time Curriculum Designer role where she can convert ambiguous strategy into measurable curriculum and LMS outcomes within a 90‑day delivery cadence. She prioritizes small probes, instrumented thin vertical slices, clear SLOs and decision logs, and must operate within governance and a ~$420,911 budget while improving completion and outcomes.",
  "personality": "Empathetic, coaching‑led communicator who favors concise narrative docs, short demos, and decision records. Martha is pragmatic and outcomes‑first, choosing probes and prototypes over debates. She values inclusion, ownership and craft, surfaces unknowns early, enforces readable artifacts and humane processes, and mentors peers while keeping error budgets and SLOs visible."
