  "needs": "I seek a full‑time data scientist role where I can deliver measurable outcomes by turning ambiguous briefs into instrumented experiments, thin vertical slices, and scalable pipelines within the first 90 days. I need clear constraints, stakeholder alignment, SLOs and decision logs, budget visibility, and fast probes to de‑risk and iterate.",
  "personality": "Direct, transparent and evidence‑driven communicator who prioritizes readable code, humane processes, and clear accountability. Prefers experiments over debates, small observable increments, and early probes to surface unknowns. Mentors through pairing and concise docs, keeps runbooks and dashboards to make operations routine and decisions traceable."
