  "needs": "Seeking a full‑time Business Analyst role where I can quickly translate ambiguous strategy into measurable outcomes by defining KPIs, mapping processes, running small probes and instrumentation, and delivering a thin vertical slice within the first 90 days. Requires autonomy to run experiments, cross‑functional access, and governance to manage budgets totaling $590,696.",
  "personality": "Collaborative and facilitative communicator who surfaces unknowns early through probes and prototypes, favors experiments over debates, and mentors peers with concise narrative docs. Values learning, ownership and velocity, optimizes for simplicity, readable code and humane processes, and makes data‑driven tradeoffs using SLOs, runbooks and transparent decision records."
