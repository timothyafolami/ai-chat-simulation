  "needs": "Seeking to deliver measurable student outcome improvements under part‑time (20h/wk) constraints by deploying small, instrumented interventions (flipped classroom, probes) and showing impact within short cycles (first 90 days). Requires clear signals, simple artifacts, budget and governance alignment, minimal disruption, and scalable processes that reduce disengagement and lift pass rates.",
  "personality": "Collaborative and facilitative communicator who prioritizes velocity, craft, and ownership. Pragmatic, outcomes‑focused, and data‑driven; prefers experiments and small, observable increments over big releases. Keeps concise decision records, runbooks and demos, mentors through pairing and clear narrative docs, and favors simplicity, readable artifacts, and accountable trade‑off discussions."
