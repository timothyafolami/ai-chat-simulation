  "needs": "Seeks short‑term or contract product leadership roles where they can rapidly clarify outcomes, instrument signals, and deliver thin vertical slices tied to measurable KPIs. Key constraints include operating with ambiguity, managing a ~$282,760 budget, establishing SLOs/runbooks, reducing time‑to‑value, and prioritizing experiments that raise activation and cut waste.",
  "personality": "Direct, transparent and data‑driven communicator who favors concise decision records, demos, and lightweight artifacts. Values reliability, evidence, and ownership, mentors by pairing, prefers small observable increments, and surfaces unknowns early through probes. Optimizes for readable code, humane processes, clear accountability, simplicity and measurable outcomes."
