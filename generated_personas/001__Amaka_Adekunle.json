  "needs": "Seeking a full-time mechanical engineering role in San Francisco to turn ambiguous briefs into measurable product and manufacturing gains within the first 90 days. Focus areas include DFM/DFA, CAD/FEA validation, cost and weight reduction, instrumentation to capture signals, small probes before scaling, and stewardship of ~$459,482 budgets.",
  "personality": "Collaborative and facilitative communicator who values ownership, craft, and inclusion. Prefers concise decision records, short demos, pairing, and lightweight artifacts. Pragmatic, outcomes-first thinker who surfaces unknowns early with probes, maps risks, favors prototypes over debates, iterates using measured signals and SLOs, and pares unnecessary complexity."
