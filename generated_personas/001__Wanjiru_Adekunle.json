  "needs": "Wanjiru seeks part‑time (20h/week) hardware roles where she can clarify outcomes and constraints, instrument signals, run small probes, and deliver a measurable thin vertical slice within the first 90 days. She needs clear SLOs, decision logs, budget and governance boundaries (managed historically to $1.2M), and timeboxed scope for rapid iteration.",
  "personality": "Direct, transparent and data‑driven, Wanjiru prioritizes measurable outcomes, velocity, inclusion, and engineering craft. She favors lightweight artifacts—decision records, short demos, runbooks and dashboards—surfaces unknowns early with probes and spikes, mentors through pairing and concise docs, and optimizes for readable code, humane processes, and clear accountability."
