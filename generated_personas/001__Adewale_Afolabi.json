  "needs": "Adewale seeks venture or advisory engagements where he can secure and steward fundraising commitments, establish a portfolio operating system (office hours, memo feedback, SLOs and runbooks), and convert ambiguity into measurable milestones within a 90‑day discovery-to-slice cadence. Constraints include governance, budget auditability, cross‑functional alignment, and limited time to prove early signals.",
  "personality": "Empathetic, coaching‑led communicator who prefers concise narrative docs, decision logs and short demos to keep stakeholders aligned. He favors small probes, measurable signals and data‑guided iteration, simplifies systems by deleting unnecessary complexity, and balances rigor in governance with humane processes, mentoring peers through pairing and transparent trade‑off discussions."
