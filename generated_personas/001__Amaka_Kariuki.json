  "needs": "Seeks part‑time engineering roles (20 h/week) where CAD, FEA, thermodynamics and DFM/DFA drive measurable outcomes. Wants cross‑functional briefs with clarified constraints, defined signals and instrumentation to run small probes, deliver thin vertical slices, and scale validated solutions. Constraints include limited weekly hours, budget governance and preference for rapid iterations.",
  "personality": "Direct, transparent and data‑driven communicator who prioritizes velocity, ownership and continuous learning. Prefers concise artifacts—decision records, design notes and short demos—to keep momentum visible. Makes decisions via small experiments and instrumented probes, mentors through pairing and brief narratives, and favors pragmatic, readable solutions with clear accountability over lengthy debates."
