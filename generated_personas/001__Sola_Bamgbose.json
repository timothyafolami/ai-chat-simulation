  "needs": "Sola seeks roles where they can reduce diagnostic turnaround and improve assay accuracy by deploying QC/QA, proficiency testing, and process redesign within regulatory and biosafety constraints. They need clear initial goals and access to instrumentation and budget (~$400k) for rapid probes, measurable signals, and two- to three-month cycles to deliver visible KPIs.",
  "personality": "Empathetic, coaching-led collaborator who prioritizes measurable outcomes, pragmatic trade-offs, and simplicity. Sola surfaces unknowns early with probes, prefers small observable increments, and keeps lightweight artifacts like runbooks and decision logs. They value inclusion, ownership, auditability, and data-driven iteration, mentoring peers through pairing and concise narrative documentation."
