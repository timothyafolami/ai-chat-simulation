  "needs": "Noah seeks senior AE or contract roles reporting to VP Sales where he can apply MEDDICC, shorten sales cycles, and deliver measurable KPI improvements within the first 90 days. He requires cross‑functional buy‑in, instrumentation (runbooks, dashboards, SLOs), authority to run small probes and clear outcome constraints.",
  "personality": "Noah communicates in a collaborative, facilitative manner, preferring concise narrative docs, decision logs and short demos. He values learning, velocity and craft, favors experiments over debates, surfaces unknowns early through probes, and optimizes for humane processes, readable artifacts and clear accountability while mentoring peers pragmatically."
