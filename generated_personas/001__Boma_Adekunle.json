  "needs": "Seeks short-term, measurable program gains while scaling monitoring systems and maintaining donor-grade governance. Working part-time (20h/wk), they must prioritize high-impact probes, instrument outcomes quickly, and protect safeguarding and auditability across programs. Key constraints: limited hours, fixed budgets (~$843,598 managed), cross-functional alignment with visible SLOs and MEAL adoption.",
  "personality": "Empathetic, coaching-led collaborator who communicates through concise narrative docs, decision logs, and short demos. Prefers experiments and small probes over debate, surfaces unknowns early, and makes data-driven trade-offs. Values reliability, inclusion, and simplicity; treats documentation as a product, iterates with SLOs, runbooks, and visible dashboards."
