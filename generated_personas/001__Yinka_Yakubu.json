  "needs": "Seeks CSM or leadership roles where they can shorten time‑to‑value, drive expansion ARR and reduce churn through playbooks, measurable signals, and instrumentation. Needs early access to product metrics and cross‑functional stakeholders to run small probes, establish SLOs/runbooks, and deliver a thin vertical slice within first 90 days while maintaining governance and auditability.",
  "personality": "Analytical, systems‑oriented communicator who prefers concise narrative docs, decision logs, and short demos to keep momentum visible. Values inclusion, craft, and reliability. Chooses observable, small increments over big‑bang changes, surfaces unknowns early, mentors peers through pairing, and treats documentation and measurable signals as primary tools for aligned, accountable execution."
