  "needs": "Adewale seeks part-time (20h/wk) content partnerships or Brand Partnerships work that turns ambiguous briefs into measurable milestones. They prioritize experiments, small probes, rapid instrumentation and clear SLOs to prove impact (CPM, audience, engagement metrics). Constraints include cross-functional alignment, budget governance, and Lisbon base with Asia/Dubai overlapping hours.",
  "personality": "Analytical, systems-oriented communicator who favors evidence, inclusion, and craft. They use concise narrative docs, decision records, runbooks and SLOs to keep teams aligned. They mentor through pairing, prefer small observable increments and experiments over debates, surface unknowns early, and prioritize readable work, humane processes and clear accountability."
