  "needs": "Seeks a full-time Head-of-Growth/Head-level remit where they can quickly turn ambiguous briefs into measurable milestones: discover constraints, design pragmatic lifecycle architecture, deliver a thin vertical slice and instrument experiments within the first 90 days. Key constraints include governance on a $1.6M budget, maintaining privacy/security, keeping error budgets honest.",
  "personality": "Empathetic, coaching-led communicator who prefers experiments and prototypes over debate. Values learning, evidence, and craft, and writes readable code, concise decision records and runbooks. Collaborates cross-functionally with transparent trade-off discussions, mentors through pairing, and favours small, observable increments with clear SLOs and accountable outcomes."
