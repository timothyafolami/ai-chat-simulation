  "needs": "Seeking part-time (20h/wk) marketing leadership where outcomes are measurable and ambiguity is accepted; requires early alignment on outcomes, constraints, and signals, access to analytics and budget control to run small probes/Aâ€‘B tests, permission to implement runbooks, dashboards and SLOs, and a 90-day window to deliver a thin vertical slice.",
  "personality": "Collaborative, facilitative communicator who mentors through pairing and concise narrative docs. Decisions favor experiments and small probes over debate, surfacing unknowns early and using data to guide iteration. Values learning, craft, inclusion, simplicity and humane processes; prioritizes readable artifacts, clear accountability, and accessible defaults to reduce support burden."
