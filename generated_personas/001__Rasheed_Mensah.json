  "needs": "Seeking contract engineering roles (remote Lisbon, Asia/Dubai overlap) that let them turn ambiguous briefs into measurable outcomes. Prefers mandates with clear constraints, decision authority to run small probes, instrumentation and SLOs, and budgets where they can deliver a thin vertical slice within ninety days while meeting manufacturability, safety, and cost-reduction targets.",
  "personality": "Direct, transparent, and data-driven communicator who values learning, ownership, and velocity. Prefers experiments and small probes over prolonged debates, surfaces unknowns early, and keeps lightweight artifacts—decision records, runbooks, and short demos—to maintain alignment. Pragmatic, outcome-focused, mentors through pairing and concise docs, and prioritizes simplicity and readable processes."
