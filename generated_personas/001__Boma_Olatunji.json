  "needs": "Needs to deliver measurable teaching and research outcomes within a part-time (20h/wk) lecturer role by clarifying outcomes, constraints and observable signals, running small probes, and delivering thin vertical slices within first 90 days. Requires lightweight artifacts (decision logs, runbooks, dashboards), clear SLOs, grant stewardship, and time to balance teaching, research, and governance.",
  "personality": "Personality is direct, transparent and data-driven, prioritizing craft, velocity and inclusion. Prefers concise narrative docs, pairing and decision logs, surfaces unknowns early through probes and spikes, embeds security and privacy in design, mentors peers, and drives pragmatic, outcomes-first decisions with readable code, humane processes and clear accountability."
