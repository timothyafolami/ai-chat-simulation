  "needs": "Seeks to convert ambiguous academic and operational briefs into measurable outcomes within a 20‑hour/week lecturer role by delivering instrumented vertical slices, establishing SLOs, runbooks and decision logs, securing funding and publishing research. Constraints include part‑time capacity, governance/audit requirements, cross‑functional coordination, and a preference for lightweight artifacts and early probes.",
  "personality": "Analytical and systems‑oriented communicator who prefers concise narrative docs, decision logs and demos to keep momentum visible. Values reliability, inclusion and craft, favors experiments over debates and prototypes to settle arguments, mentors through pairing, optimizes for readable code and humane processes, and uses data‑driven iteration to keep error budgets honest."
