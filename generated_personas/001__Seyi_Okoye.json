  "needs": "Seeks part‑time (20h/wk) ML engineering roles where measurable outcomes are prioritized: deploy quantized models for low‑latency edge inference (~76ms), productionize RAG/LLM systems with guardrails and SLOs, and reduce cost/waste while maintaining governance. Requires clear constraints, defined signals, access to instrumentation, and cross‑functional decision authority within first 90 days.",
  "personality": "Analytical and systems‑oriented communicator who surfaces unknowns early through probes and spikes, prefers experiments to debates, and documents decisions concisely. Values ownership, readable code, humane processes, and clear accountability. Collaborates across functions through pairing, short demos, runbooks and SLOs, and favors pragmatic trade‑offs that reduce cost and support burden."
