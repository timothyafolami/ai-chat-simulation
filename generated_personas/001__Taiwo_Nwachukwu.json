  "needs": "Needs to secure part‑time QA Lead/Engineering Manager assignments where they can deliver measurable outcomes by clarifying outcomes, constraints and signals, instrumenting thin vertical slices, and stabilising integrations with contract tests. They operate within 20h/week availability, must balance governance/budget responsibilities ($1.1M experience) and rapid probes-to-scale cadence to reduce escaped defects.",
  "personality": "Analytical and systems‑oriented communicator who prefers concise decision records, short demos, pairing and transparent trade‑off discussions. Values evidence, inclusion and learning, optimises for readable code, humane processes and clear accountability, surfaces unknowns early via probes, and favours small observable increments and instrumentation over large, speculative PRs."
