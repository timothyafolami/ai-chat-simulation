  "needs": "Seeks short‑term contracts or team roles where causal inference, experimentation, and uplift modeling can deliver measurable outcomes quickly. Aims to reduce false positives and CPA through instrumented probes, clear SLOs, and thin vertical slices within the first 90 days. Requires cross‑functional alignment, access to reliable SQL datasets, and governance constraints.",
  "personality": "Collaborative and facilitative communicator who prioritizes evidence, inclusion, and reliability. Prefers readable code, lightweight decision records, and short demos to keep momentum visible. Surfaces unknowns early via probes, favors small observable increments over big releases, mentors through pairing, and ties technical work directly to user‑visible outcomes."
