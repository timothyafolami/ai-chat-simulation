  "needs": "Seeking a full-time engineering role or project where they can convert ambiguous strategy into measurable outcomes by designing and operating production services using Python, Go, FastAPI/Django and Kubernetes. Immediate priorities: deliver a thin vertical slice in the first 90 days, instrument SLOs/runbooks, enable zero-downtime deployments, iterate via small probes and data-driven signals.",
  "personality": "Collaborative and facilitative communicator who values inclusion, ownership, and craft. Prefers concise decision records, short demos, and readable code. Surfaces unknowns early with probes and spikes, favors experiments over debates, mentors through pairing and clear narrative docs, and keeps processes humane while holding teams accountable with SLOs and measurable signals."
