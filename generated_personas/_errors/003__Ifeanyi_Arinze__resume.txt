Director.

Core Skills: Employee Relations, Policies, Compliance, Benefits

Selected Achievements: - Delivered initiative that improved key KPI by 65% within 71 days. -
Reduced cost or waste by 35% via process redesign and better instrumentation. - Cut
time‑to‑value for users by 74% using simpler defaults and progressive disclosure. - Managed
budgets totaling $694,282 while upholding governance and auditability.

Case Study: Launched manager playbooks; disputes down 7%. Approach: defined signals, ran small
probes, measured deltas, and scaled the chosen path. Risks were mapped with mitigations, and
results were tied to user‑visible outcomes.

Runbooks, SLOs, and dashboards turn firefighting into routine operations. We delete what we no
longer need—simplicity compounds as a strategic advantage. We keep error budgets honest and let
data guide iteration pace. I optimize for readable code, humane processes, and clear
accountability. Inclusive defaults and accessibility reduce support burden for everyone. I
