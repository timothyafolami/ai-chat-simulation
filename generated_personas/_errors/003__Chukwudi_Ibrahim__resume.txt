Case Study: Reduced SAR backlogs by 9%. Approach: defined signals, ran small probes, measured
deltas, and scaled the chosen path. Risks were mapped with mitigations, and results were tied to
user‑visible outcomes.

Case Study: Automated KYC refresh; cycle time now 4 days. Approach: defined signals, ran small

In practice, compliance officer resumes and audience‑specific narratives starts with clarifying
outcomes, constraints, and the signals we will observe. Runbooks, SLOs, and dashboards turn
firefighting into routine operations. We delete what we no longer need—simplicity compounds as a
strategic advantage. Unknowns are surfaced early through probes and spikes instead of being
buried in large PRs. Inclusive defaults and accessibility reduce support burden for everyone. I
optimize for readable code, humane processes, and clear accountability. We keep error budgets
honest and let data guide iteration pace. We delete what we no longer need—simplicity compounds
