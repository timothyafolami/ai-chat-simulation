I optimize for readable code, humane processes, and clear accountability. We delete what we no
longer need—simplicity compounds as a strategic advantage. We keep error budgets honest and let
data guide iteration pace. Unknowns are surfaced early through probes and spikes instead of
being buried in large PRs. I treat documentation as a product and keep stakeholders aligned with
crisp updates. We keep error budgets honest and let data guide iteration pace. Runbooks, SLOs,
and dashboards turn firefighting into routine operations. In practice, hr generalist practice
starts with clarifying outcomes, constraints, and the signals we will observe. We keep error
