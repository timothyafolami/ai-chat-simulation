  "needs": "Seeking a QA Lead/Engineering Manager role to deliver measurable outcomes by building test strategy, automation (Playwright, Cypress), contract and API tests, SLOs, runbooks and dashboards. Constraints include operating from Cairo on Europe/London hours, managing budgets (~$1.1M), delivering a thin vertical slice within 90â€“120 days and reducing escaped defects.",
  "personality": "Direct, transparent and data-driven communicator who values ownership, learning and reliability. Prefers small observable increments, readable code and humane processes. Uses probes and spikes to surface unknowns, applies risk-based testing and instrumentation to guide trade-offs, mentors through pairing and concise docs, and treats documentation and SLOs as products."
