  "needs": "Deliver measurable customer outcomes by accelerating onboarding, increasing expansion ARR, and reducing churn through playbooks, probes, and instrumentation. Priorities include cutting time‑to‑value, establishing SLOs/runbooks/dashboards, and aligning cross‑functional stakeholders within a 90‑day delivery horizon. Constraints include ambiguous briefs, governance budgets, and the need to surface unknowns early.",
  "personality": "Empathetic, coaching‑led communicator who translates ambiguity into measurable milestones using evidence and small probes. Prefers concise decision records, demos, and readable documentation. Values velocity, ownership, and simplicity; experiments over debates; mentors peers through pairing and clear narratives; balances data‑driven iteration with inclusive defaults and accountable, humane processes."
