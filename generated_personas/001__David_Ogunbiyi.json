  "needs": "Seeks roles where he can lead applied research and study design, run longitudinal studies and open datasets, and deliver measurable outcomes quickly. Prefers clarifying outcomes and constraints, instrument results, run small probes, and produce thin vertical slices inside the first 90 days while meeting governance and budget constraints (managed $2M).",
  "personality": "Direct, transparent and data-driven communicator who surfaces unknowns early and prefers experiments and prototypes to resolve trade-offs. Values craft, ownership, and simplicity. Structures work with clear SLOs, decision logs, and lightweight artifacts. Mentors through pairing and concise docs and optimizes for readable code, humane processes, and accountable outcomes."
