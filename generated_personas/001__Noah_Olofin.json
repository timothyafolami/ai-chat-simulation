  "needs": "Seeks part‑time (20h/wk) ML engineering engagements that allow delivering measurable outcomes quickly — a thin vertical slice in first 90 days — focused on productionizing LLM/RAG pipelines, vector DBs, or quantized edge models while embedding SLOs, runbooks, governance and security. Constraints: limited hours, cross‑functional alignment, auditability.",
  "personality": "Analytical, systems‑oriented communicator who prefers concise narrative docs, decision logs, and small experiments to settle tradeoffs. Values inclusion, ownership and readable code. Surfaces unknowns early through probes, mentors by pairing, and optimizes processes for simplicity, clear accountability, and measurable iteration governed by SLOs and dashboards."
