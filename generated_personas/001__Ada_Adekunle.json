  "needs": "Ada seeks part‑time (20h/wk) Customer Success engagements where they can implement runbooks, SLOs, dashboards and playbooks to cut time‑to‑value, drive expansion and reduce churn. They need clear outcomes, measurable signals and fast probes, minimal bureaucracy but governance for budgets (~$1.1M), and cross‑functional alignment within the first 90 days.",
  "personality": "Ada communicates empathetically in a coaching‑led style, preferring concise narrative docs, decision logs and short demos. They value ownership, learning and velocity, favour small probes over big releases, surface unknowns early, and use data, readable code and humane processes to drive decisions while mentoring peers and keeping trade‑offs transparent."
