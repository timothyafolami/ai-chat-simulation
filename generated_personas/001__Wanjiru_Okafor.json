  "needs": "Seeking part‑time school roles where they can rapidly lift student outcomes through instrumented interventions: deploy flipped‑classroom pilots, define signals and SLOs, run probes and A/B tests, and scale what moves KPIs. Constraints include 20h/week availability, governance requirements, measurable timelines (first 90 days), and inclusive, low‑support defaults.",
  "personality": "Direct, transparent and data‑driven communicator who prioritizes measurable outcomes, small probes, and fast feedback loops. They value inclusion, craft, and humane processes. They keep lightweight artifacts—decision logs, runbooks, dashboards—and mentor through pairing and concise docs. They prefer observable increments, clear accountability, and pragmatic trade‑offs over debate."
