  "needs": "Seeks contract or team-embedded data science work where they can convert ambiguous briefs into measurable outcomes by discovering constraints, designing pragmatic architecture, and delivering a thin vertical slice with instrumentation. Needs cross-functional alignment, clear SLOs and governance, budget visibility, short probes to validate uplift/causal signals, and timeboxed iterations.",
  "personality": "Collaborative, facilitative communicator who foregrounds evidence, reliability and readable code. Prefers experiments and small probes over debate, surfaces unknowns early, and uses concise decision records, runbooks and dashboards to maintain accountability. Mentors through pairing and short narrative docs, maps risks with mitigations, and favors simple, observable increments."
