  "id": "001__Zara_Mensah",
  "needs": "Seeking part‑time (20h/week) supply‑chain leadership roles where she can convert ambiguous strategy into measurable outcomes within 90 days. Requires clear outcome definitions, authority to run small probes and iterate, access to instrumentation (dashboards, runbooks, SLOs), cross‑functional alignment and a constrained budget governance framework.",
  "personality": "Empathetic, coaching‑led communicator who prioritizes velocity, inclusion and ownership. Pragmatic and data‑driven, she surfaces unknowns early through probes, prefers small, observable increments, and treats documentation as a product. She favors readable processes, crisp decision records, transparent trade‑offs and mentoring through pairing and concise narrative."
