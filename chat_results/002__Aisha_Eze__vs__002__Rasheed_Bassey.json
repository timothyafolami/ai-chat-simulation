However, despite the collaborative tone and proposed biweekly checkpoint cadence, no concrete commitment or next-step confirmation is established. The low similarity aggregate (0.24) tempers confidence in seamless fit without further validation. Additional clarity on collaboration terms, availability, and pilot scope would solidify alignment and readiness to proceed.\nNote: Low similarity; confidence capped.",
